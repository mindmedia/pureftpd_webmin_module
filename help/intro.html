<header>Pure-FTPd Server</header>

<p><i>This module allows you to configure the Pure-FTPd server installed 
on your system, set the virtual users' rights and monitor ftp sessions.</i></p>

<p>With this webmin module ou can modify the Pure-FTPd users database 
usually called <tt>/etc/pureftpd.passwd</tt> This users database allows 
the server to have virtual users differents from the system accounts 
users. Do verify that the -lpuredb:/etc/pureftpd.pdb option is set in your 
Xinetd configuration. You can modify your Xinetd configuration using 
the "Pure-FTPd configuration" panel of this module. And verify that 
your Pure-FTPd program has been compiled with 
<tt>./configure --with-puredb</tt> otherwise the Virtual users feature is 
not avalaible through the Pure-FTPd server.</p>

<p>If not using the Virtual users feature, users with accounts on your 
system can login to the FTP server and access their files using client 
programs. You can also setup a public FTP server to which 
anonymous users are allowed read-only or read-write access to a 
limited subset of files on your system.</p>

<p>The main page of this module shows a table of icons, one for each 
category of configurable options. If your system runs Pure-FTPd from 
<tt>Xinetd</tt> as most do, any changes you make will take effect 
immediately for new FTP sessions. There is a button at the bottom 
of the page allowing you to restart Xinetd after changing the Xinetd 
configuration.</p>

<p>The Pure-FTPd monitor panel only works if you had compiled your 
Pure-FTPd program with <tt>./configure --with-ftpwho</tt> as it uses 
the pure-ftpwho script to display the user's sessions.</p>
